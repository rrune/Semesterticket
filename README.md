Very simple Android app to display just the QR code of the semester ticket's pdf students get at the Universität Münster. 
It just creates a high resolution image of the pdf, cuts out the QR code and displays it, so no hassle with encryption or
anything. It works, I used it, but now use [this](https://zügli.app/) to add the ticket to Google Wallet and recommend it.
